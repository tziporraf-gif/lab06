  <h1>Website Usability Evaluation</h1>

  <h2>What is the URL of the website?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/" target="_blank">https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/</a></p>

  <h2>What is the name of the website?</h2>
  <p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc</p>

  <h2>Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
  <p>The site is intended for investors, shareholders and potential business partners.</p>

  <h2>How is the site organized?</h2>
  <p>It's a single page with many links no information or designs on the home page</p>

  <h2>Which CRAP Design Principle does the site use? Provide at least one example.</h2>
  <p><strong>Repetition:</strong> Every link on the homepage follows the same blue text style, it's a very boring style there's no designs at all. It looks like a very old style website with no graphics and it doesnt look apealing.</p>

  <h2>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</h2>
  <p>The Accessibility Audit gives the site a score of <strong>71/100</strong> There came up many issues flagged.</p>

  <h2>What is the site's effectiveness?</h2>
  <p>The site is effective in delivering information directly but with no information on the home page it's kinda hard for users to be able to understand what this website is about but if the user knows about this website is already about it's very straight forward and to the point.</p>

  <h2>What is the site's efficiency?</h2>
  <p>The site is moderately efficient. Since it is mainly text links, experienced users can navigate quickly. but with no search feature or navigation menu makes it less efficient for first time visitors.</p>

  <h2>How is the engagement?</h2>
  <p>The site's engagement level is very low, Its very plain and the text design feels outdated compared to newer websites. It is functional but not visually appealing or engaging making it not a sight that many people would want to engage in.</p>

  <h2>Recommendation for Improvement</h2>
  <p>An improvement would be to modernize the site with HTML, making a navigation menu I would use a floating one, and improved accessibility features. A search function would be helpful and more engament layout like adding sections to the home page seperating diffrent links that they had with information added and some designs to make it look appealing.</p>
